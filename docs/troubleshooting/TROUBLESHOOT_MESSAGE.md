# Troubleshooting: Message Accepted but Not Delivered

## Your Response Shows Success
```json
{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "contacts": [{"input": "12405168080", "wa_id": "12405168080"}],
  "messages": [{"id": "wamid.HBgLMTI0MDUxNjgwODAVAgARGBI0QjMyMTM3RENFRDgxMTUwMTAA"}]
}
```

The API accepted your message, but it's not reaching the phone because:

## Most Likely Issues

### 1. **Number Not Registered as Test Number**
- In Facebook Developer Console, go to WhatsApp > API Setup
- Add the recipient number to "To" field under test numbers
- You get 5 test numbers for free
- Generate the verification code and have the recipient enter it

### 2. **Wrong Number Format**
Your number `12405168080` looks like a US number (+1 240 516 8080)
- Make sure this is the correct WhatsApp number
- Recipient must have WhatsApp installed and active

### 3. **Using Test Mode**
If you're in test/sandbox mode:
- Messages only go to registered test numbers
- They don't actually send to real phones
- Check if your app is in Development or Live mode

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Register the Number as Test Number
1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com
2. Your App > WhatsApp > API Setup
3. In "To" section, click "Add phone number"
4. Enter: `+12405168080` (or the correct number)
5. Click "Send code"
6. Recipient enters the code in WhatsApp

### Step 2: Verify Number Has WhatsApp
- Ask recipient to confirm they have WhatsApp
- Number must be the same they use for WhatsApp

### Step 3: Check App Mode
- In App Dashboard, check if app is in "Development" or "Live"
- Development mode = only test numbers work
- Live mode = requires business verification

### Step 4: Check Message Status
Your webhook should receive status updates. Check Netlify logs for:
- `sent` - Message sent to WhatsApp servers
- `delivered` - Message delivered to phone
- `read` - Message read by recipient
- `failed` - Message failed (with error reason)

## Test with Official WhatsApp Test Number

Try sending to WhatsApp's official test number first:
- Number: `+1 555 025 3483`
- This won't actually deliver but confirms API works

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check webhook for status updates:**
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard > Functions > webhook
   - Look for status updates about your message ID

2. **Try a different template:**
   ```json
   {
     "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
     "to": "12405168080",
     "type": "template",
     "template": {
       "name": "sample_purchase_feedback",
       "language": {
         "code": "en_US"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Send to yourself:**
   - Register your own WhatsApp number
   - Send test message to yourself

## Success Indicators

When working correctly:
1. API returns message ID âœ… (You have this)
2. Webhook receives "sent" status
3. Webhook receives "delivered" status
4. Message appears in WhatsApp
5. Webhook receives "read" status (when opened)
